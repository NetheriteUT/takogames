### 1. RNG Aspects should mostly be removed
- Classes/Roles should be purchasable allowing for wanted roles, rarer ones would cost more. 
- Some fun ones that would require cash robux would be cosmetic based to get rid or discourage P2Wing.
- Please make the purchasable coin packs be very low so it forces players to not buy them. This would force players to actually play the game and not constantly buying items. This game does cost a bit to make so it should be balanced and be so much better.

### 2. Content Opportunity
- Big YTubers are the main source of recommendation for kids. Make it really cinematic and content based to drive in new players. You can add fun mechanics that make youtubers create videos on it to drive more traction

### 3. Exploiting/Hacking
- Try and make some sort of anti-cheat, to discourage exploiting in some games, because it discourages younger players to stop playing. Make it defend against most hacks, like deadrails, and allow for a more safer environment

### 4. AFK World
- This sounds stupid, but its effective in making users play it more
- This should only give â‚©, and no others. Its for users who haven't won anything and to feel great

## Moving on to Fun Additions
- The lobby in Ink Games in pretty bland so you could add an arena to practice fighting or just add a practice gui on the bottom middle containing "Join Queue", "Inventory", "Shop", "Practice". This could include but not limited too, practice red light green light, dalgona, challenge yourself with a selected shape, Glass Bridge, level up your eyesight on stained glass, Knife Fight, Arena Based, with bots of varying difficulty

- Cutscenes, I really loved the cutscenes from ink games. I would love to see some sort of fun cutscene for lights out or bathroom

- Movement, adding dashing, or sliding could majorly effect the game by adding some fun mechanics

Please make sure to read the whole thing and I hope you took some time to review these suggestions!
